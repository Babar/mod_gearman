TODO LIST
=========


General
-------

 - remove debug symbols (-g) and add strip (-s) again
 - remove duplicate errors from logfile
 - handle sync host checks correctly

Worker
------

 - SIGTERM on client should finish after current job
 - childs should sent back their final result after SIGTERM

WISH LIST
=========

 - no need to fork for clean plugins. (check_icmp, check_http...)
 - implement some plugins directly into worker
 - add distributing notifications ( maybe not that useful... )
