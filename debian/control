Description: Distribute active Nagios checks across your network
 Mod Gearman provides a way of distributing active Nagios checks
 across your network.
 .
 It consists of two parts:
 .
 One part is a nagios event broker module which resides in the Nagios
 core.  This module adds servicechecks, hostchecks and eventhandlers
 to a Gearman queue.  There can be multiple equal gearman servers.
 .
 The counterpart is one or more worker clients for the checks itself.
 These clients can be bound to host and servicegroups.
